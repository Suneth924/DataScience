An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.
BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company that is still in business in (almost) every country and compiled the results into a dataset. 
In this project, We explore that dataset to see what they found.
Asking questions such as
1.  How many businesses were founded before 1000?
2.  Which businesses were founded before 1000?
3.  Exploring the categories
4.  Oldest business by continent
Combining three tabels for furthur analysis
